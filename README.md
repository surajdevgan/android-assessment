# android-assessment


To develop this application I used the MVC design pattern and  Kotlin as a programming language. For handling the network requests I have used the Volley Library and to display the images, Glide Library. To show the list of followers and following I have used RecyclerView. You can also find the apk file in release section just for the testing purpose.
